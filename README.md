# Aleatorium

![buddha box with heads](Images/ImageWithHeads.png)

A lua scriptable buddha box board swap.

The hardware on this project is forked from [Eric Brombaugh's RP2040 boardswap for buddha boxes](https://github.com/emeb/RP2040_Projects/tree/main/buddhabox). I'm so glad he opensourced this, a programmable buddha machine is something that I've long wanted.

The firmware contains an lua scriptable 8 channel synthesizer and sequencer. You write new songs for aleatorium by connecting to it with usb, and loading scripts onto it with the [web based code editor](https://github.com/jonbro/aleatorium-editor).
